        <h1>My Journey</h1>
        <p>
          It was never easy for me to lose weight. Such actions require determination, consistency and most importantly motivation. For me my Journey started in my last two years in gymnasium. Before my senior year I decided to lose weight and get in shape, to have a better overall health and develop healthy eating habits. In just 3months of summer I lost about 20kg. That was a huge achievement for me. I felt stronger, healthier, more confident and most importantly I developed love for sports. After the drastic change I took slower pace with new skills that I gained. Moreover, I learned more about fitness, how to properly do exercises, how to structure my workouts, how important rest-day is, learned that streching is important and that it is important to listen to your organizm and don't over work yourself. I got more familiar with yoga, pilates and slower workouts in general. This journey was only the beginning of something better.If you want to know who inspired me and whose workouts I started with click the bottom below and follow up.

        <h2> My Journey after the summer</h2> 
		<p> My journey after the summer did not stop. I developed passiona and love for sports, I gained confidence to go to a public gym. I got to try new things and dvelop new skills. My mindset changed. I started lifting more heavy weights, tracking my progress, paying less attention to people that are working out next to me. Pictures below show how I looked when I began my journey then right after my summer and then the last photo shows me after I got into fitness more and more.
